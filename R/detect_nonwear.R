#' @description 'detect_nonwear' detects non-wear bouts and labels them as -999, without tolerance
#'
#' @param counts A vector containing the (aggregated/resampled) accelerometer counts
#' @param zerocount An integer that defines the non-wear time as number of consecutive epochs containing zero counts
#' @param epochlengthPerMin An integer that defines the number of epochs per minute
#'
#' @return counts A list that consists of \item{values}{A vector representing the cut-point classes of the corresponding bouts (e.g. 0 = non-wear, 1 = SB, 2 = LPA, 3 = MPA, 4 = VPA)} \item{lengths}{A vector representing the lengths (number of epochs) of the corresponding bouts}
